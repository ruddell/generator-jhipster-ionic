> Generates an Ionic frontend from an existing JHipster project, supports all authentication types and translation.

# Introduction

The goal of this module is to generate an  M-Ionic frontend from an existing JHipster project.  

###Key Features
Login, Registration, Settings, Password Change, and Password Reset all function the same as in a regular JHipster 
application, except with an Ionic frontend.

CORS proxy is set up in gulp/watching.js to forward gulp's live-reload to a running JHipster server.  If the JHipster 
application is running on port 8080, you should be able to log in from gulp's live-reload.  Default proxies are below.

Gulp Path | Proxies To JHipster
------------- | -------------
http://localhost:3000/api  | http://localhost:8080/api
http://localhost:3000/oauth  | http://localhost:8080/oauth


 
##### Supports:
- Auth
  - Session
  - OAuth
  - JWT
- App Types
  - Monolith
  - Gateway/Microservices
- Translation
#####Untested:
- Social Login
- Websockets

# Prerequisites
- JHipster ([Installing JHipster](https://jhipster.github.io/installation.html))
- M-Ionic ([Installing M-Ionic](https://github.com/mwaylabs/generator-m-ionic/blob/master/docs/start/installation_prerequisites.md))
- Cordova

To install everything needed, run:
```bash
 npm install -g generator-jhipster generator-m-ionic cordova ionic yo bower gulp
```
This module also requires an existing JHipster project to copy the authentication files from.

# Installation

To install this module:

```bash
npm install -g generator-jhipster-ionic
```

To update this module:
```bash
npm update -g generator-jhipster-ionic
```

# Usage
From a completely empty directory: 
```bash
yo jhipster-ionic --force
```
Follow the prompts and enter the path to your JHipster project's parent directory.  Choose the JHipster project from 
which to generate the Ionic project.  A Cordova project and an M-Ionic front-end are generated in the current directory.
  JHipster files are then be copied and formatted into the Ionic project.

Currently all JHipster files are copied to the 'app/main/jhipster' folder (except translations, see below).  The rest of the app follows [M-Ionic's project structure](https://github.com/mwaylabs/generator-m-ionic/blob/master/docs/start/file_structure.md).

To run your app with live-reload and a CORS proxy, run:
```bash
gulp watch
```
CORS settings can be found in gulp/watching.js.  Endpoints are set up for /oauth and /api to http://localhost:8080. If you are running microservices, 
you will need to add proxy paths for each of the microservice routes.

M-Ionic provides a massive tool set for an Ionic app.  For example, cordova commands have a wrapper through gulp.  Check out [M-Ionic's Dev Intro](https://github.com/mwaylabs/generator-m-ionic/blob/master/docs/start/development_intro.md) to see how to use them.


# Translation

Translations are copied over from the JHipster project into the app/i18n/ folder.  If you update your translations, either manually copy them over or re-run the generator.

# Websocket
If your ionic client shows 403 forbidden or "Origin header value 'http://localhost:3000' not allowed." in jhipster application ,then you must configure  
WebsocketConfiguration.java 
        public void registerStompEndpoints(StompEndpointRegistry registry) {
                 registry.addEndpoint("/websocket/tracker")
                 /*rest of code*/
                .setAllowedOrigins("*")
                .withSockJS().setInterceptors(httpSessionHandshakeInterceptor());
}
# On Device

To run the app on a device/emulator:
- Set up config.xml
- Add the platforms you need
  - iOS: Ensure you have the proper provisioning profile
- Make sure to specify the API url in *constants/env-prod.json* and build with --env=prod to inject the URL into all files contacting the API.
- Run the cordova command (use the wrapper to build the project before deploying it)
```bash
gulp --cordova 'run ios --device'
```

# To Do
- Entity CRUD Pages
- Admin Pages
- Re-enable ESLint - app folder is ignored in .eslintignore
- Rewrite files as they are copied instead of prompting the user to overwrite them (reason --force is in the initial command).
